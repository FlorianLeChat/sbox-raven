# Raven Scripts

This is a test directory for [S&Box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news), a new sandbox game from [Facepunch Studios](https://facepunch.com/) (like Garry's Mod but still in heavy development). The directory is based on the [Sandbox](https://github.com/Facepunch/sandbox) gamemode of the game with some modifications and improvements to create a kind of roleplay gamemode but without any real intention.

For the moment, it's just a matter of getting to know the game and its mechanics (like C#). In the future, this directory will probably be abandoned to concentrate in private server projects.

**Forgive me again to the foreigners but the comments and some messages in the code are in my native language (French) and I do not intend to modify them for the moment for the sake of simplicity.**
